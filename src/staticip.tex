IP, you need to turn off the DHCP. The way to turn off the DHCP and assign another static IP system
is to modify the following file.

    /etc/network/interfaces
\end{lstlisting}

These few lines of codes need to be added in the \verb+interfaces+ file.

\begin{lstlisting}
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.50
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 192.168.0.0
\end{lstlisting}

For the configuration of \textit{ssh} is in the following file, including the port setup.
